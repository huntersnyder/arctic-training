```{r, warning = F, message = F}

# data cleaning
read in data file 
```{r}
catch_long <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1",
                  method = "libcurl"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_long)
```

 command + shift + m gives you the pipe operators %>% 

 
```{r}

catch_df <- catch_long %>%
  #negative values remove columns
  select(-All, -notesRegCode) %>% 
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", -Year, -Region)

```

```{r}
catch_cleaned <- catch_df %>%
  rename(catch_thousands = catch) %>%
  mutate(xcatch = catch_thousands * 1000)

head(catch_cleaned)
```

```{r}
test_catch <- as.integer(catch_cleaned$catch_thousands)

i <- which(is.na(test_catch) == T)

catch_cleaned[i, ]
```
